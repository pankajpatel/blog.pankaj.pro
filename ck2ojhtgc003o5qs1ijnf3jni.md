## Introducing the FormData Viewer Extension

FormData is an amazing API to handle forms.

It allows a simple peeking into the forms as well by generating `formData` for already existing forms.

We had talked about using FormData API to handle forms in this post: [FormData API: Handle Forms like Boss ðŸ˜Ž](https://time2hack.com/formdata-api-handle-forms-like-a-boss/)

Later than that, we saw some nifty examples of file upload to Firebase and PHP Backend with the help of FormData API.

Here I am introducing the FormData Viewer Extension; an extension for Chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome, [Brave](https://brave.com/tim448), Opera, IE Edge built with Chromium, etc.
