## What happened to Hashnode API?

Hashnode API was in talks for a while but there is no mention of it anymore.

I would really love to see the API survive as the API is a really good live Data Source for many test and demo apps.

Current solutions for a API data source are:

1. Static JSON API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
2. Collection: https://apilist.fun/
3. Collection: https://any-api.com/
4. etc

I would be really happy to work on Hashnode API and showcase some extra things on top of it.

I had made previous post on [auto publishing on Github pages with github actions](https://blog.pankaj.pro/autopublish-on-github-pages-with-github-actions-ckdpo2dvq01mbl9s100b8ae3f) and I used dev.to API as as example.

In the beginning I wanted to build an aggregator of Hashnode and Dev.to, but could not find Hashnode API easily. 

Once I found it on https://api.hashnode.com/, the Schema and Docs are less helping.

Can Hashnode community managers answer this please?
