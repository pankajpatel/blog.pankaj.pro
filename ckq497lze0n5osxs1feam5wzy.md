## Today's npm package: renovate

Today's npm package is [renovate](https://www.npm/js.com/package/renovate)

Every package has some dependencies and keeping them up to date can be very time consuming and boring.

Renovate will help you keep your project's dependencies up to date via GitHub app.

Just install it on your repos and let it open Pull/Merge Requests (PR/MR) to update dependencies.

And it there are multiple PRs and one of them is merged, Renovate will rebase other PRs to not get into the conflicts.

Stay tuned for tomorrow's package of the Day.
