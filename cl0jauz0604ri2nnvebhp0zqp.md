## Can I use hover on Touch Devices?


Current web development is revolving around responsiveness when it comes to supporting multiple form factors.

Though the hardware tech is also pacing itself forward we can see a huge variety of handheld devices as they are portable and powerful.

## Current Challenge

But this brings a huge dilemma in front of Frontend developers (a.k.a web developers).

*How did we NOT handle hover in mobile/handheld/touch-enabled devices?*

With Responsive Media Queries and adding touch event handlers. On smaller devices don't add hover CSS and add touch handlers to see additional content.

And it worked great for the following reasons:

- Small form factor meant touch
- Bigger screens always come with mouse support

But nowadays, we have:
- Huge tablets in both categories of portable & large screen; Devices where screens are like a desktop but you can use these like tablets, which means you won't have access to a Mouse or precise control of the pointer
- Hover on tablet-y desktops (or desktop-y tablets ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

The good old mouse interactions are no longer available on such devices. Interactions like:
- hover
- right-click

## Solution

CSS3 have now covered this corner now with pointer media queries. It allows you to write CSS for the following values:
-   pointer: coarse
-   pointer: fine
-   pointer: none

Let's take a look at an example use of the above media queries:

```html
<button
  data-title="Get the best offers!"
  data-help="Call 1800-00-00-123456!"
>
  Subscribe
</button>
```

```css
button {
  color: #333;
  font-size: 1.3rem;
  padding: 2rem;
  background-color: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  position: relative;
  transition: all ease 200ms;
}

@media (pointer: fine) {
  button:hover {
    color: #fff;
    border-color: #000;
    background-color: #333;
  }
  button:hover:after {
    top: 90%;
  	background: #aaa;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    content: attr(data-title);
    position: absolute;
    font-size: 0.7rem;
    padding: 0.5rem 0.8rem;
    width: max(100%, 200px);
    max-width: max-content;
  }
}

@media (pointer: coarse) {
  button:after {
    content: attr(data-title);
    display: block;
    font-size: 0.75rem;
  }
  button:hover {
    color: #ddd;
    border-color: #aaa;
    background-color: #999;
  }
}
```

<iframe height="300" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Untitled" src="https://codepen.io/pankajpatel/embed/rNYQJBw?default-tab=html%2Cresult&editable=true" frameborder="no" loading="lazy" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

</iframe>

And you can also detect if no pointing is present with the device; like in following example:

```css
@media (pointer: none) {
  button:before, button:after {
    display: block;
    font-size: 0.75rem;
  }
  button:after {
    content: attr(data-title);
  }
  button:before {
    content: attr(data-help);
  }
}
```

## Hover in JS?

In our Desktop WebApps, we tend to add much interaction on Hover, But if we want the same apps to be usable on Touch devices, our JS-based interactions seem to have rendered useless.

We usually leave the hover events in place and attach extra handlers like touch-&-hold or similar.

But I think that it is not the best way, we should add hover interactions only when we know that hover is possible and the same for touch events.

For this, we have an all-around solution that allows us to run a CSS media query and see if the operation matched or not.

Yes we are talking about `window.matchMedia`

You can use `matchMedia` function to see if the window is under any responsive breakpoint or not:
```js
console.log(
  window.matchMedia('(max-width: 768px)')
);
// { matches: false, media: "(max-width: 768px)", ... }
```

Now we can use a similar `matchMedia` query to determine the pointer support. For example:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const pointerFineSupported = window.matchMedia('(pointer: fine)').matches

  if (pointerFineSupported) {
    document.querySelector('a')?.addEventListener('hover', (e) => {
      // load the linked content optimistically before click
	})
	document.querySelector('image')?.addEventListener('mouseenter', (e) => {
      // show the related caption
	})
    document.querySelector('image')?.addEventListener('mouseleave', (e) => {
      // hide the related caption
	})
  }
});
```

Similarly, we can attach [Touch Events](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#list-of-touchevent-types) like `touchstart` and `touchend` when the pointer: coarse is available

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const touchSupported = window.matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches

  if (touchSupported) {
    document.querySelector('image')?.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => {
      // show the related caption
	})
    document.querySelector('image')?.addEventListener('touchend', (e) => {
      // hide the related caption
	})
  }
});
```

Let's put the above JS snippet to use and make something UX improvements where we have used the pointer media queries to optimize the page navigation.

The prime difference between the two is:
```js
const pointerFineSupported = window.matchMedia('(pointer: fine)').matches;

if (pointerFineSupported) {
  document.querySelectorAll('[data-prefetch]').forEach(el => {
	el.addEventListener('mouseenter', (e) => {
	  const routeName = el.getAttribute('href').replace('#', '');
	  !routes[routeName].content && fetchTemplateForRoute(routes[routeName]);
	})
  })
}
```

In my [portfolio website](https://pankaj.pro); I have also used the pointer media queries in CSS to show some information that is visible on hover if you are using a desktop with a mouse to visit it.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/time2hack/image/upload/q_auto:good,f_auto/pankaj.pro-pointer-coarse.gif)

Here is the rough outline of the Styled Component for the Card handing pointer media query:
```jsx
import styled from "styled-components";

export const ImageContainer = styled.div`
  ...
  & img { ... }
`;

export const Description = styled.div` ... `;

export const Article = styled.article`
  ...

  ${ImageContainer} { ... }

  &:hover {
    & ${Description} { ... }
  }

  @media (pointer: coarse) {
    ...

    ${Description} { ... }
  }
`;
```

### Conclusion
Pointer media queries can help you tailor the UX for devices that have capabilities, like

- Prefetch content on hover for mouse
- Slide interaction for list items on touch devices
- etc.
